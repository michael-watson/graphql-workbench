## Tasks

### Priority 0 (Critical)
*Must be completed for the spec to be considered done*

- [ ] **Task 1** - Description of what needs to be done
  - Files: `path/to/file.ts`
  - Details: Additional context or constraints

- [ ] **Task 2** - Description
  - Files: `path/to/another/file.ts`
  - Details: Additional context

### Priority 1 (High)
*Should be completed but can be deferred if blocked*

- [ ] **Task 3** - Description
  - Files: `path/to/file.ts`
  - Details: Additional context

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
